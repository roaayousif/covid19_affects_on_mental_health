Conclusion

Motivation:
My motivation to explore this topic originates from my direct involvement in collecting COVID-19 data in Davidson County 
from March 2020 to October 2021. Before the pandemic, I was employed at the local health department, concentrating on 
investigating outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in Nashville. However, as the COVID-19 crisis unfolded, I was asked 
to switch my focus and collaborate with our team to address the rising number of COVID cases, resulting in a 
temporary halt to foodborne investigations.

Throughout this timeframe, I dedicated numerous hours to conducting interviews and gathering data from Davidson County 
residents regarding their COVID-19 illines post-testing postive. The compiled data was subsequently sent to the 
Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for thorough analysis. 
While it was an unforgettable chapter in my career, much like many others during the pandemic, my mental health
faced significant challenges.

Now equipped with newly acquired skills in data analysis, I am excited about conducting my own anylisis of the 
impact of COVID-19 on mental health. 

Questions:
1. Is there a correlation between the rates of COVID-19 cases and the prevalence of depression and anxiety in 
the population?

2. How does the data change over time? Are there any trends or seasonal patterns?

3. Which demographic gorups have been most affected by mental illness during COVID-19?

4. What can we learn from examining the subgroups that have been most impacted?

5. Identify the Top 10 States with the Highest Average Rates of Anxiety and Depression

Stretch question ----

What common factors or patterns might contribute to the high mental health illness 
rates in the neighboring states within the top 10? Are there regional trends, shared demographics, 
or environmental influences that could help explain this clustering of elevated mental health concerns?
