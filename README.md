Motivation:
My motivation to explore this topic originates from my direct involvement in collecting COVID-19 data in Davidson County 
from March 2020 to October 2021. Before the pandemic, I was employed at the local health department, concentrating on 
investigating outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in Nashville. However, as the COVID-19 crisis unfolded, I was asked 
to switch my focus and collaborate with our team to address the rising number of COVID cases, resulting in a 
temporary halt to foodborne investigations.

Throughout this timeframe, I dedicated numerous hours to conducting interviews and gathering data from Davidson County 
residents regarding their COVID-19 illines post-testing postive. The compiled data was subsequently sent to the 
Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for thorough analysis. 
While it was an unforgettable chapter in my career, much like many others during the pandemic, my mental health
faced significant challenges.

Now equipped with newly acquired skills in data analysis, I am excited about conducting my own anylisis of the 
impact of COVID-19 on mental health. 

Questions:
Is there a correlation between the rates of COVID-19 cases and the prevalence of depression and anxiety in 
the population?

How do mental health outcomes vary across different demographic groups, including age, gender, ethnicity, 
and socioeconomic status, during the COVID-19? 

Is there a correlation between age groups with the highest rates of COVID-19 cases in Davidson County and those 
experiencing the most severe mental health effects during the pandemic?

How has the prevalence of anxiety and depression changed over time, specifically during the period from 
March 2020 to April 2023, based on the collected COVID-19 and mental health data?

which demographic groups appear to be most affected by mental health challenges linked to the COVID-19 
pandemic?
